<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I’m Caner Çoban, a Computational Linguistics graduate with a Master’s from Eberhard Karls University in Tübingen,
   Germany. With a solid foundation in programming, natural language processing, and artificial intelligence, 
   I am driven to tackle challenges at the intersection of language and technology. 
   My academic and hands-on project experience spans advanced AI techniques, data science, and machine learning applications, 
   including projects like sarcasm detection using transformer models and the creation of a finite-state morphological analyzer for Gagauz Turkish.</p>

<p>Beyond technical skills in Python, Java, SQL, and machine learning frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow, 
  I bring a strong analytical mindset and a collaborative spirit. 
  Whether it's optimizing text embedding techniques or developing novel frameworks to quantify dialectal features, 
  I thrive in projects that allow me to push boundaries and apply innovative solutions..</p>

<p>In addition to my technical pursuits, I enjoy cycling, cinema, and the strategic challenges of gaming. 
  I am also passionate about environmental volunteering and am an enthusiast of Tolkien's Middle-earth, 
  with a particular interest in language and storytelling.</p>
